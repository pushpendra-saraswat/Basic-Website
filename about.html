        <p>Web development refers to the creation, building, and maintenance of websites. It includes aspects such as
            web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application
            that works over the internet i.e. websites. Web Development can be classified into two ways: Frontend
            Development and Backend Development. Frontend Development refers to the part of a website where the user
            interacts directly. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. The part of a website
            where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the
            application. Backend Development refers to the server side of a website. It is part of the website that
            users cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with
            the users. It is used to store and arrange data. Popular technologies used in web development include HTML,
            CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Java, Python, and more.</p>
